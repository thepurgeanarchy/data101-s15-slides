# DATA101 Critique Activity - Canvas Assignment Description

## Title
Critique Activity: Perception & Color + Reading Charts

## Overview
In this activity, you will critique real, published charts/infographics through the lens of **perception**, **color**, and **chart-reading pitfalls**. Your goal is to explain what each visualization makes easy or hard to do, identify why it can mislead, and propose a defensible redesign.

This is a writing-focused notebook (no coding required).

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this activity, you should be able to:
- Identify the **claim** a chart invites the viewer to believe
- Name the **task(s)** the chart supports (compare, detect, summarize, etc.)
- Diagnose pitfalls in **encodings** (axes, scale, position vs area, color meaning)
- Evaluate **accessibility** risks (contrast, color-only meaning, legend hunting)
- Propose redesign choices that improve **clarity, accuracy, and trust**

## Instructions (What To Do)
1. Download/open the notebook: `notebooks/perception-color-critique-activity.ipynb`
2. Keep the images in the **same folder** as the notebook (the notebook references local image files in `notebooks/`).
3. Fill in the **Group Information** table.
4. For each of the 5 case studies:
   - Read the short context + look at the figure
   - Complete the “Your Critique” section (in your own words)
5. Complete the final sections:
   - Rules of thumb (color + reading charts)
   - Summary table (one row per case)
   - References (include any additional sources you used beyond the provided figure sources)

## What To Submit
Submit **one completed `.ipynb` per group**.

Recommended filename:
`DATA101_S15_Group<YourGroupNumber>_PerceptionColor_Critique.ipynb`

## Grading (20 points)
- **Case critiques (15 pts total; 3 pts each × 5 cases):**
  - (1) Correctly identifies claim + task
  - (1) Diagnoses the main perception/encoding issue
  - (1) Proposes concrete redesign fixes
- **Synthesis + summary + references (5 pts):**
  - Rules of thumb are actionable
  - Summary table is complete
  - References are complete and consistently formatted

## Academic Integrity
Use your own words. If you consulted outside sources (including tools), acknowledge them in your References section.

## Generative AI (DLSU Policy)
This assignment follows the **DLSU Generative AI Policy for Higher Education**. If you use any generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot), you must follow the policy and the course rules below:

- **Disclosure required:** Add a short disclosure in your notebook’s **References** section stating (1) the tool used, (2) what you used it for (e.g., outlining, editing), and (3) a brief summary of prompts/outputs used.
- **Keep authorship:** Your critique must reflect your group’s own analysis. Do not submit AI-generated critiques as your final answers.
- **Verify + cite:** You are responsible for correctness. Do not include fabricated sources, quotations, or claims. If a tool suggests sources, verify them and cite the real originals.
- **Privacy:** Do not upload personal, identifiable, or sensitive data to third-party tools.
