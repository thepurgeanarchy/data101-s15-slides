    "2. **Data:** What is measured? What’s missing? What’s the unit of analysis?\n",

    "4. **Axes / Scale:** Baseline (0?), truncation, log scale, binning, smoothing.\n",
    "5. **Encoding:** Position vs length vs area vs color — is the channel appropriate for the task?\n",
    "6. **Grouping / Context:** Aggregation choices, categories, labeling, legend hunting.\n",
    "7. **Color + Accessibility:** Sequential/diverging/categorical? Perceptual order? CVD-safe? Enough contrast?\n",
    "8. **Conclusion:** Does the chart support the claim? What redesign would make it more defensible?\n"
