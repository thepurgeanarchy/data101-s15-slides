        "We designed this dashboard to answer: **which program is struggling and when**. The default view is a week-by-week pass-rate trend for the current term, with a fixed 0–100% y-axis so comparisons remain valid across all interaction states. We used **tooltips** to show exact values without adding label clutter, and **legend filtering** so a viewer can isolate a single program quickly. For drill-down, the viewer selects a **week range** and we update two outputs from the same filtered rows: a trend-in-window and a score distribution. We explicitly show the selection state in a KPI line (program, weeks, row count, worst week, pass rate, avg score) so there is no mystery state. We kept comparisons stable by fixing the distribution x-axis to 0–100 and not rescaling axes per selection. Reset is predictable: double-click resets zoom and the slider can return to the full range in one action. A pitfall we avoided is relying on hover for the main message; the default view still communicates the major differences.\n"
