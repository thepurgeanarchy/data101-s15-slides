        "We designed this app to answer: **which program is struggling and when**. The default view is a week-by-week pass-rate trend for the current term, with a fixed 0\u2013100% y-axis so comparisons stay valid. We used **tooltips** to show exact values without adding label clutter, and **legend filtering** so viewers can isolate one program quickly. For drill-down, the viewer selects a **week range** and we update two outputs from the same filtered rows: a trend-in-window and a score distribution. We explicitly show the selection state in a KPI line (program, weeks, row count, pass rate, avg score) so there is no mystery state. We kept comparisons stable by fixing the distribution x-axis to 0\u2013100 and not rescaling axes per selection. Reset is predictable: the full week range is the default, and the user can return to it in one action (slider back to full range; double-click resets zoom). A pitfall we avoided is relying on hover for the main message, so the default still communicates the biggest differences.\n"
